            <p>The Owner undertakes its utmost effort to ensure that the content provided on IllumiDesk infringes no applicable legal provisions or third-party rights. However, it may not always be possible to achieve such a result.</p>
            <p>In such cases, without prejudice to any legal prerogatives of Users to enforce their rights, Users are kindly asked to preferably report related complaints using the contact details provided in this document.</p>

            <h4>Rights regarding content on IllumiDesk - All rights reserved</h4>
            <p>The Owner holds and reserves all intellectual property rights for any such content.</p>
            <p>Users may not therefore use such content in any way that is not necessary or implicit in the proper use of the Service.</p>
            <p>In particular, but without limitation, Users may not copy, download, share (beyond the limits set forth below), modify, translate, transform, publish, transmit, sell, sublicense, edit, transfer/assign to third parties or create derivative works from the content available on IllumiDesk, nor allow any third party to do so through the User or their device, even without the User<span>&apos;</span>s knowledge.</p>
            <p>Where explicitly stated on IllumiDesk, the User may download, copy and/or share some content available through IllumiDesk for its sole personal and non-commercial use and provided that the copyright attributions and all the other attributions requested by the Owner are correctly implemented.</p>
            <p>Any applicable statutory limitation or exception to copyright shall stay unaffected.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Content provided by Users</h3>
            <p>The Owner allows Users to upload, share or provide their own content to IllumiDesk.</p>
            <p>By providing content to IllumiDesk, Users confirm that they are legally allowed to do so and that they are not infringing any statutory provisions and/or third-party rights.</p>
            <p>Further insights regarding acceptable content can be found inside the section of these Terms which detail the acceptable uses.</p>

            <br />
            <h4>Rights regarding content provided by Users</h4>
            <p>Users acknowledge and accept that by providing their own content on IllumiDesk they grant the Owner a non-exclusive, fully paid-up and royalty-free license to process such content solely for the operation and maintenance of IllumiDesk as contractually required.</p>
            <p>To the extent permitted by applicable law, Users waive any moral rights in connection with content they provide to IllumiDesk</p>

            <p>Users are solely liable for any content they upload, post, share, or provide through IllumiDesk.</p>
            <p>Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner filters or moderates such content in a preventative manner.</p>
            <p>Therefore, the Owner reserves the right to refuse, censor, remove, delete, block or rectify such content at its own discretion and to deny access to IllumiDesk to the uploading User without prior notice, if it considers such content to infringe any applicable legal provision or third party right, or to otherwise represent a risk for Users, third parties, the Owner and/or the availability of the Service.</p>
            <p>The removal, deletion, blocking or rectification of content shall not entitle Users that have provided such content or that are liable for it, to any claims for compensation, damages or reimbursement.</p>
            <p>Users agree to hold the Owner harmless from and against any claim asserted and/or damage suffered due to content they provided to or provided through IllumiDesk.</p>

            <h3>Access to external resources</h3>
            <p>Through IllumiDesk Users may have access to external resources provided by third parties. Users acknowledge and accept that the Owner has no control over such resources and is therefore not responsible for their content and availability.</p>
            <p>Conditions applicable to any resources provided by third parties, including those applicable to any possible grant of rights in content, result from each such third parties’ terms and conditions or, in the absence of those, applicable statutory law.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>How to file a takedown notice (called a “DMCA notice”)</h3>

              <li>Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple copyrighted works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site;</li>

            <p>The fees, duration and conditions applicable to the purchase of such Products are described below and in the dedicated sections of IllumiDesk.</p>
            <p>To purchase Products, the User must register or log into IllumiDesk.</p>

            <h3>Product description</h3>
            <p>Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of IllumiDesk and are subject to change without notice.</p>
            <p>While Products on IllumiDesk are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on IllumiDesk through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Purchasing process</h3>
            <p>Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.</p>
            <p>The purchasing process includes these steps:</p>
            <ul className="internal-page-list">
              <li>Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.</li>
              <li>After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.</li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <h3>Order submission</h3>
            <p>When the User submits an order, the following applies:</p>

            <ul className="internal-page-list">
              <li>The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
              </li>
              <li>In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.
              </li>
              <li>Upon submission of the order, Users will receive a receipt confirming that the order has been received.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Prices</h3>
            <p>Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.</p>
            <p>Prices on IllumiDesk are displayed:</p>
            <ul className="internal-page-list">
              <li>Either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <br />
            <h3>Offers and discounts</h3>
            <p>The Owner may offer discounts or provide special offers for the purchase of Products. Any such offer or discount shall always be subject to the eligibility criteria and the terms and conditions set out in the corresponding section of IllumiDesk.</p>
            <p>Offers and discounts are always granted at the Owner’s sole discretion.</p>
            <p>Repeated or recurring offers or discounts create no claim/title or right that Users may enforce in the future.</p>
            <p>Depending on the case, discounts or offers shall be valid for a limited time only or while stocks last. If an offer or discount is limited by time, the time indications refer to the time zone of the Owner, as indicated in the Owner’s location details in this document, unless otherwise specified.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Methods of payment</h3>
            <p>Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.</p>
            <p>Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of IllumiDesk.</p>
            <p>All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, IllumiDesk does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.</p>
            <p>If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Retention of usage rights</h3>
            <p>Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Delivery</h3>
            <br />

            <h4>Performance of services</h4>

            <h4>Trial period</h4>
            <p>Users have the option to test IllumiDesk or selected Products during a limited and non-renewable trial period, at no cost. Some features or functions of IllumiDesk may not be available to Users during the trial period.</p>
            <p>Further conditions applicable to the trial period, including its duration, will be specified on IllumiDesk.</p>
            <p>The trial period shall end automatically and shall not convert into any paid Product unless the User actively purchases such paid Product.</p>

            <br />
            <h4>Subscriptions</h4>
            <p>Subscriptions allow Users to receive a Product continuously or regularly over a determined period of time.
            </p>
            <p>Paid subscriptions begin on the day the payment is received by the Owner.</p>
            <p>In order to maintain subscriptions, Users must pay the required recurring fee in a timely manner. Failure to do so may cause service interruptions.</p>

            <br />
            <h4>Fixed-term subscriptions</h4>
            <p>Paid fixed-term subscriptions start on the day the payment is received by the Owner and last for the subscription period chosen by the User or otherwise specified during the purchasing process.</p>
            <p>Once the subscription period expires, the Product shall no longer be accessible, unless the User renews the subscription by paying the relevant fee.</p>
            <p>Fixed-term subscriptions may not be terminated prematurely and shall run out upon expiration of the subscription term.</p>

            <br />
            <h4>Automatic renewal</h4>
            <strong>
              Subscriptions are automatically renewed through the payment method that the User chose during purchase, unless the User cancels the subscription within the deadlines for termination specified in the relevant section of these Terms and/or IllumiDesk.
            </strong>
            <strong>
              The renewed subscription will last for a period equal to the original term.
            </strong>
            <strong>
              The User shall receive a reminder of the upcoming renewal with reasonable advance, outlining the procedure to be followed in order to cancel the automatic renewal.
            </strong>

            <br />
            <h4>Termination</h4>
            <strong>
              Recurring subscriptions may be terminated at any time by sending a clear and unambiguous termination notice to the Owner using the contact details provided in this document, or — if applicable — by using the corresponding controls inside IllumiDesk.
            </strong>

            <br />
            <h4>Termination notice</h4>
            <strong>
              If the notice of termination is received by the Owner before the subscription renews, the termination shall take effect as soon as the current period is completed.

            <h2>User rights</h2>
            <br />

            <h3>Right of withdrawal</h3>
            <p>Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.
            </p>

            <br />
            <h3>Who the right of withdrawal applies to</h3>
            <p>Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.</p>
            <p>Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section</p>

            <br />
            <h3>Exercising the right of withdrawal</h3>
            <p>To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.</p>
            <p>To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.
            </p>
            <p>When does the withdrawal period expire?</p>

            <p>Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.</p>
            <p>However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.</p>
            <p>Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.</p>

            <h3>…on the purchase of services</h3>
            <p>Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.</p>
            <p>Such payment shall be calculated based on the fee contractually agreed upon, and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws, compared with the full coverage of the contract.</p>
